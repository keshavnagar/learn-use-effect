when we write the set interval outside the use effect than it even run betterly when we see on our chrome browser why ? 
so this is the first doubt 
so this is done because the set interval is the external thing not the react thing it update every time the 
we also understood some thing from comment first we add the changes in one by on github
so in the screenshot that name is consoleUpdateDate , in which i add the updateDate in side  the concole.log and it look like the console.log line again and again on console than we realize how many time it 
like when we write the set interval outside the use effect we give to permision to react component every time re render than the interval creation every time but we want the interval is only in one time make and only one time when use effect is calling only one time if we do not give any thing in inside the dependency so it only create the interval one time than the interval do their work but only created one time , but here in this case it create every time and make update simultaneulsly it cuase the memory leak and unwated behavious that's why we use the use effect now we use the same code with console.log in our UE.jsx file
now you see the difference when we write inside the use effect it only changes in every one second without making the simultaneous, in previous esxample you see the one change that is when you see on the console the time is simultaneous changes because there are multiple setinterval created and there there is only set interval created that in inside the use effect and although we know why the use effect has not the dependency it even running because we are with set interval that is browser api that is not take the permit from react to when i run , it is independently running because it is not the part of react that's why it changes their value but again the listen one thing here is set interval createion is only one time becaues the use effect only create one time when the component is mounted but in previous case where our set interval that is not inside the use effect it created and also changes time in every intervals like  its like parallaly universase setinterval  created in every one second and also run the things in their own that is created burden in react that's why or reason of memory leak but there the changes is only in one second every time we also keep the cleanup funciton that clear the inteval here is one more thing it clear because the funciton return the id , we catch the id and put the inside of clean up function parameter
