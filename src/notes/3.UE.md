in UE file first we write the syntax of useEffect
and than we really see the useEffect how it give output 
so we know already when our componeont is mount than useEffect run even there is nothing in Dependency
so we add the console.log line and print something inside it 
so add the screen shot of name mounted.png file there 
now we mix the usestate and useeffect in same UE file and remove the old code
one more thing when we write the usestate or create state than we do not create inside the useeffect but we create outsidet that 
like ek mistateke ho gaya tha purane wale code ko nahi remove karna hai bas state add karna hai 
ye vohi doubt hai jo mujhe aya tha ki jab apan koi state add karte hai aur usey update karenge to kya useeffect hook bhi bar bar chalega 
jaisa ki mujhe pata hai useeffect ek bar hee chalta hai jab usme koi dependencies change na ho to 
ye doubt bhi mujhe clear hai ki jab dobara render hoga to vo vapas useeffect nahi chalega isiliye is state ko jab useeffect ke andar koi change na ho bas component first time hee chale usey apan mouted bolte hai 
to apan file effectWithState me dekh sakte hai ki apan count ko update kar rahe iska means jo apna comopnent render ho raha hai again and again fir bhi useeffect ka code bas ek bar hee chala iska matlaba jo apan ne upar line likhi thi vo bilkul sahi hai 
but suppose we want to run the useeffect when our count value is changing than is it not run even we write the count state variable inside the use effect we also will write 
so I also implement in above line countWithEffect the count is used in useeffeect but it doesnt work but we want to change 
now the comes the second argument of the useeffect like the first parameter is the callback funciton that we implement signle time when our component mount and the dependency parameter or part is now comes into the picture wheere we need to re run the useEffect when we update the counter 
like in previsou we also discuss the dependencies is the responsible for when the useEffect run the side effect like the value in dependencies array is change the effect weill re run 
so we add the state variable in dependencies like we also add in our useEffect examples
so in our depency we add the same state variable it ensure when we update the value of state our useeffect is re run 
I also add the visual in file name dependencyWithCount
